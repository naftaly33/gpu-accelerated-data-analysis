# GPU Accelerated Data Analysis and Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of GPU acceleration for solving computationally intensive problems. It compares the performance of training a Logistic Regression model using CPU and GPU.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a healthcare dataset, which contains information on patient demographics and medical history. The dataset can be downloaded from (https://healthdata.gov/ASPR/ASPR-Treatments-Locator/879u-23sm/about_data).

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/naftaly33/gpu-accelerated-data-analysis.git
   cd gpu-accelerated-data-analysis
